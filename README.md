CLOUD WRAPPER
=============

Cloud wrapper is a REST API interface to Chef server and its plugins.
Cloud wrapper intended to be a layer between your application and chef server.
This API allows your application to scale itself, create new or kill unuseful
instances.

The main purpose of this API is to manage cloud instances.

You can launch instances on different clouds, and apply chef roles to them
Also also you can use full advantages of Chef server environments and
create different autoscaling scenarios basing on monitoring data.


Cloud wrapper is in alpha stage for now.
Any feedback appreciated.
